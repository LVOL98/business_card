## Who Am I (General Section)

My name is Lukas, and I\'m a young guy from the the western part of the danish island of Zealand. More precisely the city of Holbæk which is 50 minuets drive away from Copenhagen (capitol of Denmark)

Besides of my studies in software development I also have a lot of interest in sports, in which martial arts in my biggest interest and is something I have been doing since a young age. Though i also practice Crossfit and love to go skiing, snowboarding, climbing, surfing or anything in that genre

Due to the danish education system I'm able to speak three different languages: danish (mothers tongue), english and german. Haven grown up with the internet and pursuing studies where most of our lecture and educational material is in english, I can use it without any problems. My german is a bit more lacking and I would classify it as good enough for every day use, due to the fact that the main language of my martial arts is german, and the fact that I have worked as a ski- and snowboardinstructor in Austria, where we has to teach in german,

## Ski- and Snowboarding

During my childhood my family and I would go skiing and snowboarding each year, and I really grew a love for it, so after finishing high school (gymnasium in danish) I traveled to Austria with a Company called Snowminds, who helped me take an Austrian ski- and snowboard instructor education (in german: Schnesportsleherer, antwärter, meaning ski- and snowboard instructor of first level), which I did with the ski association based in Salzburg (SSBSV: Salzburger berufsschilehrer und snowboardlehere verband).

After I finished my training, I spent around 6 month working with Fun and Pro in Flachau. TODO (more information here?!?)
